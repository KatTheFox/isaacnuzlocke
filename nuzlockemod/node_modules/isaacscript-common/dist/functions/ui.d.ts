/**
 * In the options menu, players have the ability to set a HUD offset. However, mods do not have
 * access to this value. To get around this, Mod Config Menu provides a separate HUD offset setting
 * on the first page of the menu. This is intended to be set by end-users to match their vanilla HUD
 * offset setting so that mods can render UI elements to the screen in the correct position.
 *
 * @returns If the user does not have Mod Config Menu enabled, or does not have this option set,
 * then this function will return `Vector.Zero.` Otherwise, it will return a Vector that represents
 * a HUD offset that should be added to the position of a UI element.
