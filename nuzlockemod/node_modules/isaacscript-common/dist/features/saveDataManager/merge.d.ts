/**
 * merge takes the values from a new table and recursively merges them into an old object
 * (while performing appropriate deserialization).
 * This function handles Lua tables, TypeScriptToLua Maps, and TypeScriptToLua Sets.
 *
 * Since it is common for a variable to have a type of `something | null`, we must iterate over the
 * new object and copy over all of the values. (A value of null transpiles to nil, which means the
 * table key does not exist.) The consequence of this is that it can copy over old variables that
 * are no longer used in the code, or copy over old variables of a different type, which can cause
 * run-time errors. In such cases, users will have to manually delete their save data.
